# Whatâ€™s a command interpreter?
A command interpreter, also known as a shell or command line interpreter,
is a program that interprets commands entered by a user and executes them.
It provides a text-based interface for interacting with an operating system or software application.
Command interpreters are widely used in various contexts, including
building applications, websites, and managing computer systems.

By leveraging a command interpreter in your development process, you can
streamline tasks, improve efficiency, and build more robust and scalable
applications and websites. Whether automating deployments,
managing configurations, or integrating with external services,
the versatility of command interpreters makes them invaluable tools for developers.

# How to Use/Start the interpreter:
To start the command interpreter, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application or website is located.
Then, execute the command to launch the interpreter.
`` python interpreter.py ``

Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands followed
by any necessary arguments to perform various actions within the application or website.
The interpreter will interpret these commands and execute the corresponding functionalities.

#### Examples
`` > help ``
`` > deleterusr guest ``
`` > updateusr_settings guest email=guest@ipsum.com ``
